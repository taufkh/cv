                    As the project manager for the project, my
                    primary objective is to ensure that our
                    implementation of Odoo meets the specific needs
                    and requirements of the company. In order to
                    achieve this, I will be working closely with the
                    team to ensure that we effectively utilize the
                    Sales, Inventory, Purchase, CRM, and Helpdesk
                    modules provided by Odoo
